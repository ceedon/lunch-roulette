Lunch Roulette is a tool for finding diverse dining groups among coworkers and friends. It uses staff data (stored in Google Sheets or in CSV form) to generate small lunch groups of people from different teams and tenures who haven't dined together before.

With a single command, Lunch Roulette will download staff data and participation survey results from Google Sheets, scan through thousands of possible lunch groups until it finds the best one, update the Google Sheet with the results, and print out the emails of each group for dispersal. 

This is a forked version of the original [Lunch Roulette](https://github.com/fredbenenson/lunch-roulette), written and [blogged about](https://kickstarter.engineering/lunch-roulette-f5272a3990b9) by [Fred Benenson](https://twitter.com/fredbenenson)üêã.

## How it works

Lunch Roulette is a command line application written in Ruby. It requires a CSV file with staff information and "features," such as their team, manager, and start date. This file can live offline in CSV form, or it can exist as a Google Sheet, which Lunch Roulette accesses through the Google Sheets API. 

It is run using the ruby executable:

```ruby
ruby lib/lunch_roulette.rb
```

Features are things like the team that a person is on, or the day they started. These features can be weighted in different ways and mapped so that some values are "closer" to others.

Along with specifying the various weights and mappings of Lunch Roulette users, other configurable options include the number of people per group, the number of iterations to perform, and the number of groups to output:

```
Usage: ruby lunch_roulette.rb [OPTIONS]
  -n, --min-group-size N           Minimum Lunch Group Size (default 4)
  -i, --iterations I               Number of Iterations (default 1,000)
  -v, --verbose                    Verbose output
  -d, --dont-write                 Don't write to files
  -h, --help                       Print this help
```

A Dummy Staff
==============

So that you can run Lunch Roulette out of the box, I've provided a dummy staff (thanks to Namey for the hilariously fake names) dataset in data/staff.csv


Configuring Lunch Roulete
=========================

At the minimum, Lunch Roulette needs to know how different individual features are from each other. This is achieved by hardcoding a one dimensional mapping in `config/mappings_and_weights.yml`:

```
team_mappings:
  Community Support: 100
  Community: 90
  Marketing: 80
  Communications: 70
  Operations: 50
  Product: 40
  Design: 30
  Engineering: 20
  Data: 0
specialty_mappings:
  Backend: 0
  Data: 20
  Frontend: 30
  Mobile: 50
  Finance: 100
  Legal: 120
weights:
  table: 0.6
  days_here: 0.2
  team: 0.9
  specialty: 0.1
min_lunch_group_size: 4
```

Lunch Roulette expects all employees to have a team (Community, Design, etc.), and some employees to have a specialty (Data, Legal), etc.

Gut Testing Lunch Roulette
==========================

If specified, Lunch Roulette will output the top N results and/or the bottom N results. This is useful for testing its efficacy: if the bottom sets don't seem as great as the top sets, then you know its working! This will output 2 maximally varied sets, and two minimally varied sets:

```sh
ruby lib/lunch_roulette.rb -v -m 2 -l 2 data/staff.csv
```

If you wanted to get fancy, you could set up a double blind test of these results.

CSV Output
==========

Unless instructed not to, Lunch Roulette will generate a new CSV in data/output each time it is run. The filenames are unique and based off MD5 hashes of the people in each group of the set. Lunch Roulette will also output a new staff CSV (prefixed staff_ in data/output) complete with new lunch IDs per-staff so that the next time it is run, it will avoid generating similar lunch groups. It is recommended that you overwrite data/staff.csv with whatever version you end up going with. If used with the verbose option, Lunch Roulette will dump a TSV list of staff with their new lunches so you can paste that back into Google Docs (pasting CSVs with commas doesn't seem to work).
